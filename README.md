The Computer Structure &amp; Language course @ Sharif University of Technology ---Fall2017-2018. 
Taught by Professor Hossein Asadi @ Computer Engineering Department

HW4: Practical assignments on programming in MIPS assembly language, including mathematical & string operations.

HW5: Practical assignments on implementing a program with a command interface and working with arrays in MIPS assembly language. 

HW6: Practical assignments on programming in MIPS assembly language, to implement a basic calculator and sorting algorithms.

HW7: Implementing micros in MIPS assembly language for several indirect operations. Also, implementing an encryption algorith on strings in MIPS assembly language.

HW8: Practical assignments on programming in Intel 8086 assembly language, including QuickSort, and many other mathematical operations such as Comb(n, r) or some recursive algorithms. 

HW9: Transforming C code into MIPS assembly.

Project1: A joystick controlled program in Arduino. The program is implemented both in C and assembly. The project was implemented on breadboard and on Arduino.

Project4: A project on implementing a simple Python program on RaspberryPi and implementing its circuits in practice.
